# linked_list_implementation

This program is an implementation of the linked list data structure. 
The narrative logic implemented throughout is used to show the additon and substruction of the links. 
The handling of the links by their respective indexes shows an understanding of the associated functionality. 
By concatenating the linked list strings with an arrow the pointers of the linked list can be better visualised. 
An undersatnding of more complex pythonic syntax is also on display here.
